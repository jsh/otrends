# Perfect Lives

What's a perfect life?  How about a life where every day is better
than the last? A life where you're happier every day than all the
days that came before.

Is that likely? No.

For example? Imagine that your happiness is at the mercy of fate. Each day, the universe reaches into a hat, picks a random number, and that's how your day goes.

If you live for 70 years -- 25,000 days or so -- then that's 25,000 random number. (No two days are exactly the same, so we'll represent that as 25,000 random reals.)  How many arrangements of those numbers have every day get better? One. Out of 25000!.

That's roughly 0.0, followed by a ginormous number of 0's.

# Trends

"It's getting better all the time."

Okay, what if we relax our criteria a little. Suppose you declare a near-perfect life to be one where, despite ups and downs, there's a general upward trend?

An example will make this clearer. Let's just look at a week.  Again, we'll let
fate pull your daily numbers out of a hat.  The odds that every day
will be better than the last are only 1/5040 -- about 0.0002)
But what about a week like this?

	Sunday - 2
	Monday - 1
	Tuesday - 4
	Wednesday - 3
	Thursday - 6
	Friday - 5
	Saturday -7

(Yes, I know, those aren't reals. Just put a ".0" after each one if it bothers you that much.)

Clearly, every other day is worse than the day before, but there's also, just as clearly, an upward trend.

Let's declare a "trend" to be a life where at the end of every day, when you go to sleep, the average day up until now in your life wasn't as good as the average days still left to you. How does that improve your odds?

Skipping the math -- though I can go back and do it later -- if you look over N days, there's at least a 1/N chance that that you'll ride an upward trend for the whole time.

For a 70-year span, the odds that the whole thing is an upward trend is about one in 25,000.  Perhaps that still seems small.

Boulder has about 100,000 people. If it's 1 in 25,000, about four Boulderites will have perfect lives.

The rest of us? Not so perfect.  Life has setbacks.  Maybe you move
somewhere for work that's a worse place to live. Maybe you get a really bad
divorce. Maybe you get cancer.

Whatever.

That's happiness more like this: 92 47 41 98 70 74 14 88 18 83
Things start out great (92), then you move (47).
Things bounce around a bit, but then you get a divorce (14).
Thing bounce back up (88) until, suddenly, you get cancer (18).

Still, you can decompose this into a set of trends:
92 | 47 41 98 70 74 | 14 88 | 18 83

Every one of these chunks is a trend. In each case, when you had a setback, you got back on the horse and looked to the future.

How many trends does a typical life of 25,000 days have? What's the average?
Eleven. Ten setbacks. Each trend's a bit under seven years.

# It Depends on How You Look at It.

"An optimist says 'the glass is half full,' a pessimist says, 'the glass is half empty.' An engineer says, 'The glass is twice as big as it needs to be.'"

"Ah," you're saying, "but wait.  What if I look at my life as a series of *downward* trends?  All the math must be the same. There must be about four people in life who, at any given point, can say the rest of their life is, on average, going to get worse.

That's a whole life's equivalent to a week like this:

	Sunday - 7
	Monday - 5
	Tuesday - 6
	Wednesday - 3
	Thursday - 4
	Friday - 1
	Saturday -2

Sure.

But even a week that sucks as badly as that can be seen like this

7 | 5 6 | 3 4 | 1 2

A week with some setbacks.

So that's an important point: you get to decide.

Even if everyone else looks at you and says, "Well, my life's not perfect, but at leat it's not *his*," you can still look at your life as a series of upward trends with some setbacks.

How many?

I've said that randomly-generated sequences have an average of a dozen upward trends.

If you restrict yourself to looking at randomly generated sequences
of 25000 reals that form a single, downward trend, and, polyanna
that you are, you insist on looking at them as upward trends with
setbacks, what's the average number of setbacks? How long are the
average trends *upwards*, if that's how you choose to see them?

Guesses?

Eighteen setbacks, interspersed by four-year trends in which what's coming is better than what came before.

Even if you're at the mercy of fate, and it, just from bad luck, uncaringly deals you a bad hand for your entire life, you have a choice.

You can say, "Woe is me.  Oy, vey's mir. The best is behind me."  

Or you can say, "Yeah, my luck's not great, but I have good stretches
of many years at a time."

If fate's coin flips had been more typical, they might have been six
or seven years long instead of only four.

Same data. Your choice of how to see it.

# Some Math.

(1) 25000!

By Stirling's approximation, N! ~ sqrt(2*pi*N)*(N/e)^N = C*(N/e)^N
N = 2.5*10^4
C = 2*pi*n ~ 6*N ~ 15*10^4
sqrt(2*pi*N) ~ 4*10^2 
N/e ~ 2.5*10^4/2.7 ~ 10^4
(N/e)^n ~ (10^4)^(2.5*10^4) = 10^(10^5)
So 25000! ~ C*10^(10^5), or C followed by 10^5 zeroes.
1/25000! is "0." followed by 10^5 zeroes before the first non-zero digit.

Yowza.

(2) P(a single, upward trend) = 1/N

Consider a sequence of N random reals.  At least one circular permutation has a single trend. The subsets that are circular permutations of one another are mutually exclusive, equivalence classes. Thus, the upward trends are at least 1/N of all permutations.


(3) Finding a circular permutation that is a single trend.

Any sequence of random reals can be decomposed uniquely into non-overlapping, adjacent trends. The means of these trends decrease, monotonically, from left to right.

Rotate the leftmost trend to the right end. These two trends will merge into a single trend. It's entirely possible that this new trend will merge with its neighbor, in turn, and so on. If that makes the entire, rotated sequence a single trend, we're done.  If not, take the leftmost remaining trend, rotate it to the right end, and continue until there's only one trend.
